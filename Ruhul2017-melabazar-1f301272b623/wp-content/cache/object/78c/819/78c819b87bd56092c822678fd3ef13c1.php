Mine is travel-sized which makes it great to carry around. Now, I was super excited to try this because I've tried water-based and oil-based makeup removers before and they each have their pros and cons. I heard that gel makeup removers fill in that gap. With its oil-free, 100% soap-free formula, it is suitable for all skin types and can wipe off any makeup without leaving any residue. With added Aloe Vera, Vitamin B5 and Hydrolyzed Soy Protein, it can keep the skin feeling soft while the PH level of 5.5 restores skin's healthy balance.";s:10:"post_title";s:41:"SilkyGirl pure fresh makeup remover -55ml";s:12:"post_excerpt";s:0:"";s:11:"post_status";s:7:"publish";s:14:"comment_status";s:4:"open";s:11:"ping_status";s:6:"closed";s:13:"post_password";s:0:"";s:9:"post_name";s:55:"silkygirl-pure-fresh-all-in-one-gel-makeup-remover-55ml";s:7:"to_ping";s:0:"";s:6:"pinged";s:0:"";s:13:"post_modified";s:19:"2017-03-19 06:01:52";s:17:"post_modified_gmt";s:19:"2017-03-19 06:01:52";s:21:"post_content_filtered";s:0:"";s:11:"post_parent";s:1:"0";s:4:"guid";s:91:"http://localhost/melabazar/product/silkygirl-pure-fresh-all-in-one-gel-makeup-remover-55ml/";s:10:"menu_order";s:1:"0";s:9:"post_type";s:7:"product";s:14:"post_mime_type";s:0:"";s:13:"comment_count";s:1:"0";}}
